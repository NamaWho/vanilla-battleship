## Introduction

Historical reinterpretation of the classic ***Battleship*** game. <br> 

The following project has been presented as a Practical Project of ***Web Development*** course for the Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, taken at the University of Pisa. Final evaluation: **30/30**.

The project, due to strict deadlines and the purpose it's been developed for, could present redundancies, non-commented or unclear parts. A refactoring should be performed ( *feel free to open a pull request :)* )

## Functionalities
- Sign-in and Sign-Up on the platform
- Single-player mode vs a Bot
- Dashboard, Stats and Snapshot of previous played match.

## Setup
For this project I used XAMPP in order to setup easily all the stuff. 

1. Setup ***php/key/sql-credentials.json*** with your MySQL server connection credentials.
2. Open a connection with your db server (using XAMPP you just need to open phpmyadmin on the browser typing ***localhost/phpmyadmin***) and execute the db dump which you can find [here](https://github.com/NamaWho/progetto-pweb/blob/master/sql/pweb_battleship_latest.sql).
3. If you are using XAMPP, move the project folder in ***C:/XAMPP/htdocs*** directory. (It depends on where you installed XAMPP, this is the default path)
4. Type _localhost_ on the browser and click on the project folder name. 
5. Enjoy the game! :)
